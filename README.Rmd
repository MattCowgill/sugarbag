The **sugarbag** package creates tessellated hexagon maps for visualising geo-spatial data. Hexagons of equal size are positioned to best preserve relationships between individual areas and the closest focal point, and minimise distance from their actual location. This method allows all regions to be compared on the same visual scale, and provides an alternative to cartograms.

Maps containing regions with a few small and densely populated areas are extremely distorted in cartograms. An example of this is a population cartogram of Australia, which distorts the map into an unrecognisable shape. The technique implemented in this package is particularly useful for these regions.
