[![CRAN\_Status\_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/sugarbag)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sugarbag)
[![Downloads](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/sugarbag?color=brightgreen)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sugarbag)

The **sugarbag** package creates tessellated hexagon maps for visualising
geo-spatial data. Hexagons of equal size are positioned to best preserve
relationships between individual areas and the closest focal point, and
minimise distance from their actual location. This method provides an
alternative to cartograms that allows all regions to be compared on the same visual scale.

Maps containing regions with a few small and densely populated areas are
extremely distorted in cartograms. An example of this is a population
cartogram of Australia, which distorts the map into an unrecognisable
shape. The technique implemented in this package is particularly useful
for these regions.

## Installation

You can install the CRAN release version of sugarbag from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("sugarbag")
```

You can install the development version from GitHub using:

```{r github, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("srkobakian/sugarbag")
```

## Getting started

There are two ways of creating hexagon maps using sugarbag: 

1. Use `geom_sugarbag()`; OR
2. Assemble the map manually.

Both methods are outlined below. `geom_sugarbag()` is easier but less customisable than assembling the map manually.

We show how to create a map of Tasmania using each method. Tasmania is the southern-most state of Australia, consisting of one large land
mass and several smaller islands. We will use the Australian Bureau of Statisticsâ€™ ESRI shape files to build our map. The shapefile has been filtered to contain only Tasmania. 

The package contains these shapefiles of Tasmania - `tas_lga` for local government areas, and `tas_sa2` for ABS Statistical Area Level 2 - for example purposes. 

```{r}
library(sugarbag)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(tibble)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
```

### Making a map with `geom_sugarbag()`

The `geom_sugarbag()` function provides a simplified way to make sugarbag tesselated hexagon maps. Here's an example:

```{r}
tas_lga %>%
  ggplot(aes(fill = lga_code_2016)) +
  geom_sf(alpha = 0.4, linewidth = 0) +
  geom_sugarbag(aes(geometry = geometry)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  theme_map() +
  theme(legend.position = "none", aspect.ratio = 1)
```

Note that we first create a standard `geom_sf()` layer. This displays the actual polygons in the data, over which we lay the hexagons using `geom_sugarbag()`. 

All you need for `geom_sugarbag()` is an SF dataframe - a dataframe of class "sf" that contains a geometry column that describes polygons. `geom_sugarbag()` will handle the process of converting those polygons to hexagons and placing them in the appropriate place. 

### Making a manual sugarbag map

`geom_sugarbag()` (above) provides a streamlined way of making hexagon maps. But it is less configurable than making the sugarbag maps manually.

To make a sugarbag map manually, there are four key steps:

1. Calculate the centroid of each polygon in your data;
2. Create a grid of possible locations for the hexagons to be placed on your map;
3. Allocate each polygon to one of the possible hexagon locations;
4. Visualise the results, typically using `geom_polygon()`.

These steps are outlined below.

#### Calculate centroids from polygons

The function `create_centroids` finds the central points of the polygons
provided as an argument.

```{r}
# Find the longitude and latitude centroid for each region or area
centroids <- create_centroids(tas_lga, "lga_code_2016")
```

#### Create grid of possible hexagon locations

To tessellate correctly, all the hexagons must be evenly spaced. This
function creates a grid of possible locations for the polygons.

```{r}
grid <- create_grid(centroids = centroids, hex_size = 0.2, buffer_dist = 1.2)
```

The `sugarbag` package operates by creating a grid of possible hexagons
to allocate electorates. The buffer extends the grid beyond the
geographical space, this is especially useful for densely populated
coastal areas or cities, such as Brisbane and Sydney in this case,
Hobart.

#### Allocate polygon areas to hexagon locations

Each polygon centroid will be allocated to the closest available hexagon
grid point. The capital cities data set will be used to preserve
neighbourly relationships. The `allocate` function requires two inputs,
the centroids and the grid.

```{r}
# Allocate the centroids to the hexagon grid
# We have the same amount of rows, as individual regions
hex_allocated <- allocate(
  centroids = centroids,
  hex_grid = grid,
  hex_size = 0.2, # same size used in create_grid
  hex_filter = 3,
  focal_points = capital_cities,
  width = 30, 
  verbose = TRUE
)
```

The function `fortify_hexagon` assists in plotting. We now have 6 points
per region, one for each point of a hexagon. Connecting these points
will allow actual hexagons to be plotted.

The additional demographic information or data can now be added. This
can be used to allow plots to be coloured by region.

#### Visualise
```{r}
hexagons <- fortify_hexagon(data = hex_allocated, sf_id = "lga_code_2016", hex_size = 0.2)

polygons <- fortify_sfc(tas_lga) %>% 
  mutate(poly_type = "geo")

ggplot(mapping = aes(fill = lga_code_2016)) +
  geom_polygon(data = polygons, 
               aes(x=long, lat, 
    group = interaction(lga_code_2016, polygon)), 
               alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_polygon(data = hexagons, 
               aes(x=long, lat, 
    group = interaction(lga_code_2016))) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  theme_map() +
  theme(legend.position = "none", aspect.ratio = 1)
```

For animations to move between geography and hexagons the `sf_id` must
match, there also needs to be an identifier to separate the states to
animate between for `gganimate`.
