\title{Create a tesselated hexagon map from a set of polygons}
\usage{
create_hexmap(shp_path, buffer_dist = NULL, hex_size = "auto",
  filter_dist = 5000, focal_points = NULL, export_shp = FALSE,
  show_progress = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{shp_path}{character vector location of shape file, extension .shp}

\item{buffer_dist}{distance in degrees to extend beyond the geometry provided}

\item{hex_size}{a float value in degrees for the diameter of the hexagons}

\item{filter_dist}{distance around centroid to consider grid points}

\item{focal_points}{a data frame of reference locations when allocating
hexagons, capital cities of Australia are used in the example}

\item{export_shp}{export the simple features set}

\item{show_progress}{a boolean to indicate whether to show polygon id}
}
\value{
a data set containing longitude and latitude of allocated hexagon
points for each non null geometry passed in the shape file
}
\description{
Allocates each polygon in a shape file to a grid point to create a map of
tesselated hexagons. The spatial relationships of areas are preserved while
the geographic chape of each area is lost.
