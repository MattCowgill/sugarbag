Description: From a set of polygons, a data set is created to plot spatial
    distributions. Each polygon is represented by a hexagon tile, placed as
    close to it's original centroid as possible with a focus on maintaining
    spatial relationships with neighbours. Primarily used to allow analysis 
    of spatial distributions within Australia, which can be difficult to
    analyse using geographic maps.
