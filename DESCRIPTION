Description: Create a hexagon tiling from spatial polygons. Each polygon is 
    represented by a hexagon tile, placed as
    close to it's original centroid as possible with a focus on maintaining
    spatial relationships with neighbours. Developed for the visualisation and analysis 
    of spatial distributions across Australia, which can be challenging due to
    the concentration of population on the coast and wide open interior.
